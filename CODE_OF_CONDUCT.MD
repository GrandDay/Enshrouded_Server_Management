# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### ✅ Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient with newcomers and those learning

### ❌ Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-focused requests or conversations

## Educational Context

This project originated as an educational/lab project. Keep this learning focus in mind:

- **Be patient with beginners** - Everyone is learning
- **Share knowledge freely** - Help others understand
- **Ask questions respectfully** - No question is "stupid"
- **Provide context in answers** - Help people learn, don't just give code
- **Encourage experimentation** - It's okay to break things in VMs

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- Code comments and documentation
- Community discussions and forums
- Email communications regarding the project
- Social media mentions and discussions

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (project maintainers) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via GitHub's reporting features or by creating a private security advisory.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Technical Disputes

Technical disagreements are normal and healthy. When disagreeing:

- **Focus on technical merits** - Discuss code, not people
- **Provide evidence** - Link to documentation, examples, test results
- **Be open to being wrong** - We all make mistakes
- **Assume good intent** - Not everyone explains things the same way
- **Escalate constructively** - If stuck, ask for third-party input

Examples of constructive technical discussion:
- ✅ "This approach might cause issues with X. Have you considered Y instead?"
- ✅ "I tried this and got error Z. Here's my environment details..."
- ✅ "According to PowerShell docs, this cmdlet works differently in 5.1 vs 7+"

Examples of unconstructive technical discussion:
- ❌ "This is a stupid way to do it"
- ❌ "You clearly don't know PowerShell"
- ❌ "Real developers would use X instead"
